You are an expert full-stack web developer and UX copywriter working on the website www.rise.sk, which sells programming services, websites, automations, IT teaching, AI services, e-shops, mobile apps and similar digital services.

Your task:
Create a complete page (content + structure, and optionally code if needed) for a special “gift” page that gives visitors free tools and checklists to self-audit their digital business. The page must create reciprocity and naturally lead to contacting us (RISE) when they discover problems.

High-level concept:
- This page is positioned as a FREE DIGITAL HEALTH CHECK for entrepreneurs and small businesses.
- It contains grouped checklists and links to external tools so visitors can quickly validate whether their:
  - website works well,
  - SEO is good,
  - page is fast,
  - mobile experience is solid,
  - brand and design look professional,
  - social media presence is strong,
  - LinkedIn / Instagram / Facebook profiles are optimized,
  - email and signature look professional,
  - business name and branding are consistent,
  - mobile app (if they have one) is healthy,
  - AI is used smartly in their business,
  - processes are automated effectively.

Tone & UX:
- Friendly, helpful, and clear. No jargon if not needed.
- Written as: “We prepared a free gift for you – use these tools and checklists to see if you’re on the right path as an entrepreneur.”
- The goal is: help them score themselves, fix easy things alone, and then contact us for deeper work.

Overall layout of the page:
1. HERO SECTION
   - Headline ideas (choose 1 and implement):
     - “Free Digital Health Check for Your Business”
     - “We Prepared a Free Tech Check for Your Business”
   - Short explanation paragraph: this is a free self-audit of website, SEO, social media, branding, AI, and automations. No email required.
   - 2 main buttons:
     - “Start My Free Tech Check” → scrolls to first checklist section.
     - “Send My Reports to RISE” → scrolls to contact form at bottom.
   - Optional small subtext: “Fix quick wins yourself. If something is broken, we’ll help you repair it.”

2. HOW IT WORKS (3 STEPS)
   - Step 1: Run the free tools and go through the checklists.
   - Step 2: Note what’s green (OK) and what’s red (needs work).
   - Step 3: Send us your results and we’ll propose a simple plan.

3. MAIN CONTENT – MODULES (each as a card/section)
For each module below, create:
- A short intro (1–2 sentences explaining why it matters).
- A “Quick self-check” list (bullet points).
- A “Run these free tools” subsection (just descriptive, use placeholder links like #).
- A small CTA paragraph inviting them to send results to us if they are not satisfied.
